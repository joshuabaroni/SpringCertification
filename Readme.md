  * it is the job of external objects or frameworks to provide concrete dependencies to objects
* Types of dependency injection
  * Constructor injection
  * Setter injection
  * Interface injection
* Advantages of using Dependency Injection
  * Reusability (of code)
  * Readability ""
  * Maintainability ""
  * Testability ""
  * Reduces coupling
  * Increases cohesion
### Q2 Patterns and Anti-Patterns: Is Dependency Injection a Pattern?
* _software design pattern_ - reusable solution to commonly occuring problems in software design
  * high level description of how to solve a problem

* Some examples of commonly used design patterns from GoF Design Patterns
  * Factory Method
  * Builder
  * Template Method
  * Strategy
  * Observer
  * Visitor
  * Facade
  * Composite
* __dependency injection__ is a pattern that solves the problem of flexible dependency creation
